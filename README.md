# Project Feedback & Evaluation

### Challenges
* Finding a 'DRY' approach to the game logic within the time frame (plans in the pipleine to refactor). 
* Animating the removal of the gems and dropping down the above rows.

### Future Opportunities
* Better handle the visual updating of the grid to create more effective waterfall animation. 
* Animate the gems swapping when selected.
* Prevent users from swapping gems when the move doesn't result in a 'winning' row.
* Introduce more levels with larger grids and more gem variation.
* Award points for L-shape gem combinations.
* Optimise the game for mobile devices.

### Known Bugs/Issues
* Board visualisation doesn't show until all columns have been checked for a match.
